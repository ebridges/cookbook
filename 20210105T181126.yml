  Surprisingly, our perfect prime rib recipe turned out to be one cooked in a 200-degree oven. Unlike roasts that cooked at higher temperatures, this one was rosy pink from the surface to the center and was the juiciest and most tender of all the roasts we cooked. The only thing that bothered us about this slow-roasted prime rib was its raw-looking, unrendered fatty exterior. By searing the meat on top of the stove before low-roasting it, though, we solved this problem in our prime rib recipe.
  Even if you don't purchase the roast a week ahead of time as the instructions suggest, even a day or two of aging in the refrigerator will help.
  We didn't tie the first few prime ribs that we roasted. We found out pretty quickly, though, that unless the roast was tied, the outer layer of meat pulled away from the rib-eye muscle, causing the roast to look a little unattractive. Separated from the main roast, this outer flap of meat also tended to overcook. To solve this problem easily, tie the roast at both ends running parallel to the bone.
ingredients: |
  first-cut beef rib roast, 3 ribs (about 7 pounds), set at room temperature for 3 hours, tied twice between the rib bones
  Salt and ground black pepper

directions: |
  Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Heat large roasting pan over two burners set at medium-high heat. Place roast in hot pan and cook on all sides until nicely browned and about 1/2 cup fat has rendered, 6 to 8 minutes. 
  Remove roast from pan. Set wire rack in pan, then set roast on rack. Generously season with salt and pepper. 
  Place roast in oven and roast until meat registers 130 degrees (for medium-rare), about 3 1/2 hours (or about 30 minutes per pound). Let stand 20 minutes (a bit longer is fine) before serving. 
  Transfer to cutting board and carve.
  To carve, remove the twine and set the roast on a cutting board, rib bones perpendicular to the board. Using a carving fork to hold the roast in place, cut along the rib bones to sever the meat from the bones.
  Set the roast cut side down; carve the meat across the grain into thick slices.
