notes: |
  That time when you form a soft ball is critical: if it cooks a bit too long it will harden when you are beating it.
  If cooked too little it will stay soft and not hold its shape.
ingredients: |
  1½ cups sugar
  ½ cup milk
  4 tablespoons butter
  1/8 teaspoon soda
  1 teaspoon vanilla
  2 squares unsweetened chocolate
  Nuts if desired
directions: |
  Put all together except vanilla and cook over a brisk heat, stirring constantly. 
  Cook until spoon leaves a heavy trace when stirring.
  If you have a candy thermometer cook to “soft ball”; if not have a cup of very cold water (I put an ice cube in it) and drop about ½ teaspoon of mixture into the cold water, try to form a ball with your finger. If it will not hold together, cook a bit longer but keep testing as it will get too hard very quickly. 
  As soon as you get a “soft ball” remove from fire and place pan into cold water (plug the sink and run cold water to the depth of the mixture in the pan, or use a larger pan.) and beat until creamy.
  Add vanilla while beating, add nuts when it begins to cream.
  Pour into a buttered platter to cool, cut into squares.
