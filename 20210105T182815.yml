notes: |
  This makes a medium consistency frosting, which is very spreadable and creamy.
  For a stiff decorator frosting: add more powdered sugar, ½ cup at a time, until desired consistency (about another cup or so.)
  For a thinner consistency to fill cupcakes or sandwich cookies, add about ½ cup less powdered sugar.
ingredients: |
  1 C. unsalted butter, softened
  2 ½ C. powdered sugar (or more, depending on desired consistency)
  Pinch of salt
  6 oz. good quality white chocolate, chopped (NOT white chocolate chips or candy melts!)
  ¼ C. heavy whipping cream
  ¼ tsp. vanilla extract
directions: |
  Put the chopped white chocolate into a small bowl. Heat the chocolate in 30 second increments in the microwave set to 60% power. Stir after each increment, and continue to heat 30 seconds at a time, until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Set aside and allow to completely cool.
  Once white chocolate has cooled, sift the salt and powdered sugar over the butter, in a large bowl. Cream the butter and sugar mixture together until light and fluffy, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed.
  Measure the whipping cream into a cup, and stir in the vanilla extract.
  With the mixer running on low speed, gradually pour the cream mixture the bowl.
  Once the cream mixture has been incorporated into the frosting, fold on the melted (but cooled) white chocolate until incorporated.
  Increase the mixer speed to medium-high, and beat frosting for an additional 3 minutes.
