notes: |
  Our easy buttercream recipe is made with just butter, sugar, flavorings, and a touch of cream. It can be made ahead of time and refrigerated, but must be brought to room temperature to soften before serving.
  Any of the buttercream frostings can be made ahead and refrigerated; if refrigerated, however, they must stand at room temperature to soften before use. If using a hand-held mixer, increase mixing times significantly (at least 50 percent). This recipe can be doubled to make enough for a two-layer cake.
  You can substitute orange zest & juice to make Orange buttercream.
ingredients: |
  10 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
  3/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest 
  1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar (5 ounces)
  Pinch table salt
  2 teaspoons lemon juice 
  1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
  1 tablespoon heavy cream

directions: |
  In standing mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat butter at medium-high speed until smooth, about 20 seconds. 
  Add lemon zest and beat mixture at medium-high speed to combine, about 15 seconds. 
  Add confectioners' sugar and salt; beat at medium-low speed until most of the sugar is moistened, about 45 seconds.
  Scrape down bowl and beat at medium speed until mixture is fully combined, about 15 seconds; scrape bowl, add lemon juice, vanilla, and heavy cream, and beat at medium speed until incorporated, about 10 seconds, then increase speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down bowl once or twice.
