ingredients: |
  1½ cups of honey
  Scant cup sugar
  2 tablespoons butter
  5½ cups flour
  1 tablespoon baking powder
  1¾ cups hulled almonds
  1 cup candied lemon peel, minced
  ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
  1 teaspoon ground cardamom
  Pinch ground cloves
  Pinch black pepper
  1 egg
  1 cup confectioners' sugar
  1 teaspoon lemon juice
  1 tablespoon hot water
directions: |
  Combine the honey, sugar and butter and heat while stirring constantly until you have a smooth, well-blended mixture. Allow to cool.
  Put four cups of the flour and the baking powder in a mixing bowl. Split a dozen of the nicest almonds and set aside; mince the rest. Add the minced almonds and candied lemon peel to the flour along with the spices; mix well. Add the egg and stir in vigorously, then work in the cooled honey mixture. Gradually add more flour to the dough, using only enough to produce a dough that no longer adheres to the side of the mixing bowl. 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a baking sheet with butter. Roll out the dough about three-quarters of an inch thick on a surface that has been sprinkled with flour; cut out the gingerbread men with the help of a cardboard stencil or a cookie cutter. Place the cookies on the baking sheet and bake for about 15 minutes.
  In the meantime, mix the confectioners sugar with the lemon juice and hot water; brush the gingerbread men with this sugar glaze when they emerge from the oven and attach the almond halves using the glaze as an adhesive.
