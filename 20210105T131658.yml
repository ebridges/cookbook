notes: |
  Haddock, red snapper, halibut, and sea bass also work well in this recipe and those that follow as long as the fillets are 1 to 1¼ inches thick.
  If your fish has a thin tailpiece, tuck it under so it cooks at the same rate as the rest of the fillet: Cut halfway through the flesh crosswise, 2 to 3 inches from the tail end, then fold the tail end under the cut seam to create a fillet of even thickness.
  The packets may be assembled several hours ahead of time and refrigerated until ready to cook. If the packets have been refrigerated for more than 30 minutes, increase the cooking time by 2 minutes. Open each packet promptly after baking to prevent overcooking. Zest the orange before cutting it into wedges.
ingredients: |
  1 large fennel bulb (about 1 pound), trimmed, halved, cored, and sliced into 1/4-inch strips (about 4 cups)
  2 medium shallots, sliced thin (about 1/2 cup)
  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
  2 medium oranges, 1/4 teaspoon finely grated zest removed from one; both peeled, quartered, and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick pieces (see note)
  1 medium garlic clove, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)
  2 teaspoons minced fresh tarragon leaves 
  4 tablespoons vermouth or dry white wine
  4 skinless cod fillets, 1 to 1-1/4 inches thick (about 6 ounces each)
directions: |
  Combine fennel and shallots in large microwave-safe bowl; cover tightly with plastic wrap. Microwave on high power until fennel has started to wilt, 3 to 4 minutes, stirring once halfway through cooking. Combine butter, zest, garlic, 1 teaspoon tarragon, ¼ teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in small bowl. Combine orange pieces and remaining teaspoon tarragon in another small bowl; set aside.
  Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Cut eight 12-inch sheets of foil; arrange four flat on counter. Divide fennel and shallot mixture among foil sheets, mounding in center of each. Pour 1 tablespoon vermouth over each mound of vegetables. Pat fish dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper and place one fillet on top of each vegetable mound. Spread quarter of butter mixture on top of each fillet. Place second square of foil on top of fish; crimp edges together in ½-inch fold, then fold over three more times to create a packet about 7 inches square (see illustrations, above). Place packets on rimmed baking sheet (overlapping slightly if necessary).
  Bake packets 15 minutes. Carefully open foil, allowing steam to escape away from you. Using thin metal spatula, gently slide fish and vegetables onto plate with any accumulated juices. Serve immediately, spooning orange and tarragon mixture over fish before serving.
