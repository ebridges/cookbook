categories: [bakery, dessert, cake, icing, lemon]
ingredients: |
  6 egg yolks
  1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
  1/2 teaspoon salt
  zest of 1 lemon
  1/2 cup plus 2 Tbls sugar
  1 1/4 cup (3 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter – cool but not cold
  1 vanilla bean
  1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
directions: |
  Add the egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, lemon zest and sugar in a double boiler and turn it on to medium heat. Whisk constantly for about 6 minutes – until the mixture is thickened, light in color and hot.
  Pour the mixture into a standing mixer bowl fitted with the whisk and whip the mixture on high for about 5 minutes until it has cooled off and lightened in color to a pale yellow.
  Once the mixture has cooled (feel the side of the bowl to make sure it’s cool) add the butter about 1/4 stick at at time, whipping until smooth, periodically stopping to scrape the sides. Then add the vanilla bean and vanilla extract and whip again.
  If the frosting is too soft, stick it in fridge for 20 minutes or so. Then scrape it down and whip for 1 minute.
