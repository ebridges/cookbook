ingredients: |
  1 Cup Milk
  3 Egg Yolks
  1 Egg
  1/4 Cup Sugar
  4 Tablespoons Flour
directions: |
  Scald the milk in a heavy 2-quart saucepan. Remove from heat.
  Beat the egg yolks, egg and sugar together for 2 to 3 minutes, until the eggs thicken and lighten in color. Beat in the flour.
  Slowly pour the hot milk into the egg mixture, beating constantly.
  Return this mixture to the saucepan, and cook over medium heat, whisking and scraping the bottom constantly until the mixture comes to a boil. It should thicken to about the consistency of pudding. Cook a few seconds longer, then strain into a metal bowl.
  Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pastry cream, and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours.
