directions: |
  Bring a large pot of water to a boil then blanch the beef shanks. You don't want to cook them all the way through, just about 2-3 minutes. This allows the impurities to get cooked off. Remove the beef shanks and discard the water with the impurities. 
  Add the beef shanks to the pressure cooker then add the remaining ingredients. You DON'T need to add water because the beef naturally releases water throughout the cooking process.
  Using the meat preset (or similar), pressure cook the beef. With my mom's pressure cooker, she had to run the meat preset twice. If this confuses you, just pressure cook it for 25-26 minutes.
  In the meantime, cook the noodles and divide evenly into bowls.
  Once the pressure cooker is done and pressure is released, add meat and soup on top of noodles.
