  Mother Dull says: "this is without any exception the best tea cake or cookie recipe I have ever used."
  Do not put too close to touch as this will spoil the shape. 
ingredients: |
  7 cups flour
  2 cups sugar
  1 cup butter
  ½ cup buttermilk
  3 eggs
  ½ teaspoon soda
  2 teaspoons baking powder
  1 teaspoon vanilla
directions: |
  Flour sufficient to make a soft dough (a note by me says about 7 cups)
  Cream butter and sugar, add eggs.  
  Into 1 cup of flour sift soda and baking powder
  Add to sugar mixture
  Add milk, vanilla and enough flour to make a soft dough. Don’t overdo the flour as you will turn the dough onto a floured board to knead.
  Turn onto a floured board, knead until smooth, roll out ¼ inch thick.  
  Cut into any shape.  Bake in a moderate oven until done. (A note by me says: Bake  12 minutes at 375 degrees)
