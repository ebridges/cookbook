ingredients: |
  1 pound spaghetti
  3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
  2 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly mashed
  ½ pound pancetta or slab bacon, cut into 1-inch-long matchsticks
  3 large eggs
  ¼ cup grated Romano cheese
  ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
  1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  2 tablespoons chopped parsley
directions: |
  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet set over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the garlic and cook, stirring, until the garlic is golden, about 3 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic. Add the pancetta to the pan and cook, stirring frequently, until it just begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. 
  Put the eggs in a large serving bowl and whisk them lightly. Whisk in the cheese and pepper. 
  When the pasta is cooked, drain it but leave a little water clinging to the noodles. Add the hot noodles to the bowl with the eggs and cheese and toss well until all the noodles are coated. Reheat the pancetta and add it to the pasta along with the parsley and toss again.
