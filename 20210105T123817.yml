name: Scharffen Berger Chocolate Frosting 
servings: 1-1/2 cups frosting
source: Scharfen Berger Chocolate
categories: [cake, dessert, gluten-free, icing]
notes: |
  For the smoothest and glossiest frosting, allow it to cool and thicken slowly at room temperature (without stirring) while you make your cupcakes! 
  Makes about 1 1/2 cups of frosting – enough for 12 cupcakes or a small cake.
ingredients: |
  3 ounces unsweetened SCHARFFEN BERGER 99% unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped 
  4 tablespoons (2 ounces) unsalted butter, cut into several pieces 
  2/3 cup heavy cream 
  2/3 cup sugar 
  1/8 teaspoon salt 
directions: |
  Place the chocolate and butter in a medium bowl and set aside.
  Bring the cream, sugar, and salt to a simmer in a large saucepan, simmer for 4 minutes, stirring frequently.
  Pour the hot cream over the chocolate, whisk just until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth and glossy.
  Set aside to cool at room temperature, without stirring for 2 to 3 hours, or until the frosting is cool and thick enough to spread.  Or, refrigerate the frosting for about 45 minutes or more (but not until it is hard) without stirring, then let it stand at room temperature until it is the desired consistency.
