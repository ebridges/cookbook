notes: |
  Can be made GF by skipping the breadcrumbs & using GF pasta.
ingredients: |
  5 tablespoons unsalted butter
  2 cups panko or coarse dry bread crumbs
  5 cups coarsely grated extra-sharp Cheddar
  3 tablespoons flour
  ½ teaspoon hot red pepper flakes
  2 cups whole milk
  ½ cup heavy cream
  2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
  1 pound elbow macaroni
  Salt & freshly ground black pepper

directions: |
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Butter a 3-quart baking dish. Fill a large pot with salted water and bring to a boil. 
  In a medium pan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter. Add the bread crumbs and 1 cup of cheese and stir until combined. Set aside. 
  In a saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the remaining butter. Stir in the flour and red pepper flakes and reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Whisk in the milk and raise heat to medium. Simmer, whisking occasionally, for 3 minutes. Stir in the cream, remaining cheese, mustard, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and 1 teaspoons salt. 
  Cook the macaroni until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water before draining. In a large bowl, combine the macaroni, cooking water and sauce. Transfer to the baking dish and spread evenly with the topping. Bake until golden, 20 to 25 minutes.
