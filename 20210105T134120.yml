  For a roasted leg of lamb recipe without the gristle or gaminess, plus great garlic flavor, we started with a meaty, boneless shank end. We separated the meaty loaves to create tidy mini-roasts from which we diligently trimmed away all visible fat and gristle, thus eliminating gamy flavors and making the roast very easy to carve once roasted. Next, we introduced garlic and herb flavors to our roasted leg of lamb recipe with a seasoned brine. We added even more garlic flavor by rubbing a roasted garlic paste onto one side of the lamb.
  Brining doesn't do much for beef â€“ its muscle fibers turn to mush--but the technique works wonders for lamb. The salt breaks down the fibers just enough to tenderize the meat, and the crushed garlic imbues it with deep flavor.
  Look for rolled, boneless leg of lamb wrapped in netting, not butterflied and wrapped on a tray. The desirable cut is the "shank end," which is the whole boneless leg without the sirloin muscle attached. If only bone-in or semi-boneless leg is available, ask your butcher to remove the bones for you. Plan on spending about 30 minutes trimming the lamb of fat and silver skin. This advance work is well worth the effort; your roasts will present elegantly and have a much cleaner flavor. (That said, even 10 minutes of trimming will improve the taste dramatically, see instructions below). If you opt for the 30-minute trim, you will have enough meat scraps left over to make the Roasted Garlic Jus. The lamb can be trimmed, brined, rubbed with paste, and tied, then stored overnight in the refrigerator (do not season the meat). Allow the lamb to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before proceeding with the recipe.
ingredients: |
  # Lamb and Brine
  1/4 cup kosher salt (or 2 tablespoons table salt)
  1/4 cup sugar
  12 medium cloves garlic, crushed
  5 - 7 pound boneless leg of domestic lamb with sirloin muscle removed
  
  # Garlic-Parsley Paste
  2 medium heads garlic, outer papery skins removed and top third of head cut off and discarded
  1 tablespoon olive oil
  2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves
  Kosher salt and ground black pepper
  3 tablespoons olive oil
directions: |
  Combine salt, sugar, and crushed garlic with 2 quarts water in large bowl or container; stir until salt and sugar dissolve. Prepare lamb as shown through illustration 4 (see below, "Preparing the Lamb"). Submerge lamb in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 2 hours.
  While lamb brines, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Place garlic heads cut side up on sheet of aluminum foil and drizzle with olive oil. Wrap foil tightly around garlic; place on baking sheet and roast until cloves are very soft and golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. When cool enough to handle, squeeze garlic head to remove cloves from skins. Mash cloves into paste with side of chef's knife. Combine 2 tablespoons garlic paste and parsley in small bowl. (Reserve remaining paste for Roasted Garlic Jus, if making; see related recipe.)
  Remove lamb from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Finish lamb preparation (illustrations 5 and 6). Season each roast with salt and pepper.
  Heat vegetable oil in 12-inch ovensafe skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Place lamb roasts in skillet and cook until well browned on all sides, about 12 minutes total. Place skillet in oven and roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into center of each roast reads 125 degrees for medium-rare, or 130 to 135 degrees for medium to medium-well. (Roasting time will range from 8 to 25 minutes depending on size of roasts; begin checking after 7 minutes and transfer each roast to platter as it reaches desired temperature.) Let lamb rest, tented with foil, about 15 minutes. Snip twine off roasts, cut into 1/4-inch slices, and serve.
