  Brining is basically putting the turkey in a fancy salt water bath. Hereâ€™s how to do it.
  10-18lb bird: 3-3.5 hours
  18-22lb bird: 3.5-4 hours
  22-25lb bird: 4-4.5 hours
ingredients: |
  Turkey from 10-25lb. See chart for times.
  3-4 tablespoons butter
directions: |
  Let your turkey sit out at room temperature for approximately 45 minutes.
  Our butchers recommend hitting your turkey with high heat, and then backing off.
  Start out at 400 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes to crisp the skin and render some fat out and then take the oven temperature down to 325 degrees for the rest of cooking.
  Roast the bird for the allotted time on the chart, basting with pan juices every hour. During the last 45 minutes of cooking, add a knob of butter to the crest of the bird and allow it melt over the skin. Baste with the butter and juices one more time. According to USDA standards, you want an internal temperature of 165 degrees. Everyone's oven is different. Pay attention to the temperature of your bird for the last 45 minutes.
  Be sure to let the bird rest for 30 minutes before carving.
