notes: |
  For an oven-roasted salmon recipe that would give us a nicely browned exterior and a silky, moist interior, we developed a hybrid roasting method, preheating the oven to 500 degrees but then turning down the heat to 275 just before placing the fish in the oven. The initial blast of high heat firmed the exterior and rendered some excess fat. The fish gently cooked in the oven and stayed moist as the temperature slowly dropped. Our oven-roasted salmon recipe was complete when we added an easy relish whose acidity and flavors balanced the richness of the fish.

  4 tangerines, rind and pith removed and segments cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 1 cup)

  1 1/2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger 
  2 teaspoons juice from 1 lemon
  2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil 
  Salt and ground black pepper

  Place tangerines in fine-mesh strainer set over medium bowl and drain for 15 minutes.
  Pour off all but 1 tablespoon tangerine juice from bowl; whisk in scallion, ginger, lemon juice, and oil. Stir in tangerines and season to taste with salt and pepper.
